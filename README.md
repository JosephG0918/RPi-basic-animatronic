# Animatronic Raspberry Pi Project

A basic animatronic powered by a **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W** that moves its eyes, eyelids, jaw, and neck. Input is handled via a **4x4 matrix keypad**, and power is supplied by a **7.4V Li-ion battery** with soft and hard shutdown controls.

## Project Overview
- First animatronic project using a Raspberry Pi and Waveshare 16-Channel Servo Driver HAT.
- Uses **7 micro servos** to animate 3D-printed parts (eyes, eyelids, jaw, neck).
- Each button on the keypad controls a specific component; one button triggers all simultaneously.
- Includes soft shutdown via momentary push button and hard power switch via rocker switch.

> ⚠️ Always press the soft shutdown button before toggling the main power switch to avoid SD card corruption.
